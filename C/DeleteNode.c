 *    Description: Delete a node in a Linked list (guaranteed not at the end), access to the head is restricted.
 *    Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/
 *    Approach:
 *          - We need two pointer (backPtr and frontPtr). Back Pointer at the given node and front pointer to its subsequent node.
 *          - We copy the next -> node val to the current node -> val.
 *          - The above step is repeated until the front pointer reaches the final node.
 *          - Once it is done, we do a final copy and change the back pointer's next value to NULL & free the front pointer's memory.
